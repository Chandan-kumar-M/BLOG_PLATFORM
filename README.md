Trade-offs and Design Decisions


Trade-offs:

1)  Service Decomposition:
The application is divided into three distinct services (User, Blog, Comment). This design promotes separation of concerns and allows for independent scaling and deployment of each service but introduces complexity in communication between services.
2)  Database Choice:
PostgreSQL was chosen for its robustness and support for complex queries and relationships, particularly with foreign keys in the comment and blog services. However, this choice may lead to increased setup complexity compared to simpler databases like SQLite.
3)  JWT Authentication:
Using JWT for authentication allows stateless sessions, which simplifies scaling but requires careful management of token expiration and revocation.
4)  Dockerization:
Each service is containerized using Docker, which simplifies deployment and environment consistency but adds overhead in terms of resource usage compared to running services directly on the host machine.
   


Design Decisions:


1)  RESTful API Design:
The API follows RESTful principles, making it intuitive for developers to understand how to interact with the services based on standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).
2)  Environment Management:
Environment variables are managed using .env files for both local development and production environments, allowing for flexible configuration without hardcoding sensitive information in the codebase.
3)  Error Handling:
A centralized error handling middleware is implemented to manage errors gracefully across all services, providing consistent error responses to the client.
4)  Documentation:
Comprehensive API documentation is provided to facilitate ease of use and integration by other developers or teams who may use the API in their applications.
